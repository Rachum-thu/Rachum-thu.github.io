Nice to meet you! I am a first year [MSCS](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/ms-program/) (Master of Science in Computer Science) student from [Siebel School of Computing and Data Science](https://siebelschool.illinois.edu/), [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/). My research interest includes Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, and Text Mining.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jiawei Han](https://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/) from Data [Mining Group](http://dm1.cs.uiuc.edu/) at [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/). I was adivsed by [Prof. Zhiyuan Liu](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/) from [Natural Language Processing Lab](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/).

You can find my CV here: [Runchu's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
